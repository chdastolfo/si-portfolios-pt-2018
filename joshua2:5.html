            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"> </p>
            <p>I was born at <a href="http://www.lrgh.org/">Lakes Region Hospital </a> New Hampshire on February 21st, 1994 at 11:45 in the morning. I was raised north in the town of <a href="http://www.sandwichnh.org"> Center Sandwich</a> for the first 14 years of my life. I lived with my two brothers <a href="https://www.facebook.com/snungesser">Samuel</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/caleb.nungesser">Caleb</a>, my mother Colleen and my father William. While life in the woods was tedious at times and little internet or cable to go around, we managed to have a good life and develop many interests and hobbies.
            </p>

            <p>When I turned 14 I was sent to boarding school in the nearby town of <a href="https://www.holderness.org/page">Holderness</a>. For the next four years of my life I lived on a campus, developed my passions and made the best friends of my life. High School is tough for everybody but we had it pretty good and the lessons in and out of the classroom have had a phenomal amount to do with the person I have grown up to be.
