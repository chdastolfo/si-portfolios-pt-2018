				<h3>About This Page</h3>
				<p>Learning the fundamentals of web design and development can sometimes feel like I'm being taught to run before I've begun to crawl. I know that frameworks like Bootstrap save developers the trouble of building websites from scratch, but I worry that by relying on these frameworks as a beginner will mean I'll avoid having to achieve true competence in the basics of web design. Constantly reinventing the wheel is no virtue, but failing to understand the nature of the wheel while trying to service the car's engine will almost certainly lead to mistakes and lost time down the road.</p>
				<p>In order to understand the building blocks of web design, I've constructed this site from scratch, without the aid of any CSS or Javascript frameworks. I've tried to make it aesthetically pleasing, but I've also tried to creative integrate some more advanced CSS, so some of the content may seem disjointed. In any case, I think it showcases my ability to learn and implement essential coding concepts, with an eye toward form as well as function. I hope it's as fun for you to explore as it was for me to make.</p>
